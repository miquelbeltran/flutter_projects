  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/data/regular_units.json
   - assets/icons/area.png
   - assets/icons/currency.png
   - assets/icons/digital_storage.png
   - assets/icons/length.png
   - assets/icons/mass.png
   - assets/icons/power.png
   - assets/icons/time.png
   - assets/icons/volume.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font.
  fonts:
   - family: Raleway
     fonts:
      - asset: third_party/Raleway-Regular.ttf
